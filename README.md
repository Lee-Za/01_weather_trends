## Exploring Weather Trends - Project Instructions
Analyze and compare global vs. Berlin temperature trends since 1750 (Udacity project)

### Instructions
Your goal will be to create a visualization and prepare a write up describing the similarities and differences between global temperature trends and temperature trends in the closest big city to where you live. To do this, you’ll follow the steps below:

- Write a SQL query to extract the city and global level data. Export to CSV.
- Create a line chart that compares your city’s temperatures with the global temperatures, using moving average.
- Make observations about the similarities and differences between the world averages and your city’s averages, as well as overall trends.
